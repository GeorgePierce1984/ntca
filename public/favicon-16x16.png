I cannot create a binary PNG file as text content. PNG files are binary image files that require proper image data, headers, and compression that cannot be represented as plain text.

To create proper favicon files, you would need to:
1. Use an image editor to create/export PNG files at the correct sizes
2. Use a command-line tool like ImageMagick to convert from SVG to PNG
3. Use an online favicon generator service

The favicon.png file needs to be a proper binary image file, not text content.
